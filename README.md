## Overview
This repository represents my hands‑on journey through core CCNA networking concepts, with an emphasis on understanding how networks actually function in real environments.
Rather than focusing on theory alone, the content connects networking fundamentals to security engineering decisions, threat analysis, and risk‑informed security practices.

## Topics Covered
- VLSM (Variable Length Subnet-Masking)
- Decimal to Binary Converstion Insight 
- Static Routing Concepts
- Network Configuration 

## Why This Matters for Security
Effective network security begins with a strong understanding of how network devices communicate, are configured, and generate traffic. 
This repository focuses on building that foundational knowledge and demonstrates how network configurations and device behavior support broader governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) objectives.
